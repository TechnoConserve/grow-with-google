                The Red Fox has a long history of association with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and
                furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology.

            A strain of truly domesticated red foxes was introduced by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over
            a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those
            individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that
            showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and
            appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no
            longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show
            affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats,
            floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.
